            <h1>Chaos Source Engine</h1>
            <p>Chaos Source is a branch of <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com">Valve Software's</a> Source Engine based off Counter&#8209;Strike:&#160;Global&#160;Offensive.</p> <!-- <===== These are non breaking characters -->
            <p>The main goal of Chaos Source is to provide a shared engine base for many different Source Engine projects, so that those mods can benefit from each other instead of every team having to implement the same features independently.</p>

        <h1>Engine FAQ</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="pt-2">Why is it not open source?</h2>
        <p>We're big fans of open source, but since Chaos Source uses licensed source code, the engine code cannot be open sourced.</p>
        <p>This is however the only code that cannot be open sourced.
            All of our other tools like, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/ChaosInitiative/AssetBuilder">asset builder</a>, are all open source, if possible.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-2">Do you use leaked code?</h2>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> All of our projects are green-lit, licensed and endorsed by Valve. We do not use <u>any</u> leaked code and will never leak ourselves.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-2">Is there an SDK?</h2>
        <p>No. Due to the way source is set up and certain conditions, Chaos Source is only accessible in our games and cannot be distributed as standalone SDK. </p>
        <p>If you wish to create a single-player game with Chaos Source features, Portal 2: Community Edition would probably suit your project the best, even for non-portal mods. </p>
