            <p>
                A modern game should use modern formats, so we stripped Portal 2's old BINK video support 
                and made our own WebM video implementation!
            </p>
            <p>
                This results in better quality and framerate as well as <b>massive</b> file size reduction. 
                A win-win for everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                You can now also load custom videos in your map.
