                Electromagnetic Reflector Gel
            </h2>
             <p>
                 Good ol' reflection gel. Has been there for years but always disappointed. 
                 Well not anymore! Not only is the reflection gel now a fully functional element,
                 it's also got some new tricks up its sleeves by now reflecting <em>everything</em>.
             </p>
             <p>
                 From lasers to hard light bridges. This now reflects it all!
